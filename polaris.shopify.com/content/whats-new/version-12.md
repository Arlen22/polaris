## Upgrade to v12

Follow our [migration guide](https://polaris.shopify.com/migrating-from-v11-to-v12) to upgrade Polaris from v11 to v12.

## Why are we making changes?

Polaris version 12 gives consuming apps access to Shopify's new admin design language. Breaking token and component changes lay the foundations for theming support and unified component APIs.

### Design philosophy

- Hierarchy primarily through typography reduces cognitive load and makes the important content easier to find
- Using black and white reduces noise and ensures color is used for signifiers and affordances instead of as decoration instead of decoration
- Increased density enables a fuller picture of the task at hand
- Visual dimension clearly distinguishes layers of importance and interactive elements
- Delightful, tactile interactivity makes taking action feel powerful and gratifying
